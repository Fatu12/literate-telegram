Rest/Spread:
    ES6 provides us with a new operator, ..., that is context dependent. 
    Its purpose is to capture the rest of a data set, or to spread content 
    of an existing structure.
Destructuring:
    when you get the rest it can give u the result in two different object 
    REACT 
        React is going to be the code that runs on our user's browser, displaying the information 
        we want them to see, reacting to user input, being responsible for not just the look and feel 
        of our web app but most of its interactivity as well
    React can be used to build a single page application or SPA, which will make our website feel more 
    responsive by eliminating page loads for our users
    React isn't opinionated about what technology we use with it; we can choose the libraries we use for: http requests,
    front-end routing, styling, etc
    React doesn't prevent us from using DOM manipulation already built into JavaScript
    DOM is nothing but, a javascript object, react only updates section of the page where the change was made
    no the entire page which is super efficient 
    Virtual DOM is way faster then the regular DOM
    REACT USE COMPONENTS 
        Which means that web application are divided into small COMPONENTS
        COMPONENTS is a small piece of the user interface 
    TWO TYPES OF COMPONENTS
    FUNCTIONAL  AND CLASS-BASED
    JSX is used in REACT to describe what the User interface should look like 
    PROPS:
        allow you to pass dynamic data through react COMPONENTS
        props are just arguments that you pass into react components 
        they are passed via attributes, they are just a shorter way of saying 
        properties
        State  in react is a plain javascript object used by react to represent piece of 
        information about the component's current situation, completely manged by the component itself
    SCOPE 
        scope is that are available to you with everything
    let you can't have access to after the function, but var you does, what I mean is 
    that var is globe available
Synthetic Events
    onChange - an event that runs when a form input is changed
    onSubmit - an event that runs when a form is submitted
    onFocus - an event that is run when an element is given focus (clicked on or tabbed to)
    onBlur - an event that is run when an element loses focus (the user moves away from the element)
useState:
    is spacial way of  holding data in variables over our renders
    the different between the props and state is that props is the way we pass information
    from parent component to child COMPONENTS the values are all read only
    state we able to hold data pacific  this instance ,but it also has ability to 
    update that values 
    State we use holding, update and changing values
    In useState that we can create two local variables that we can use anywhere in our 
    component.The first element of the returned array will be used to get (show) the current 
    state value(not necessarily the initial state).
    The second array element is a function used update this value. These are sometimes referred
    to as "getters and setters."

    :The "getter" name should describe the data it is holding
    :The "setter" is named the same as the "getter" with the prefix of set
